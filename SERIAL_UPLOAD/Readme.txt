Note, you must install arduino for the serial upload to work. The latest Pi_grammer image should have this done already, but if needed, here is the command:

sudo apt-get install arduino

Note, you will need to plug in an ethernet cable to your pi 2, to connect to the internet. 
I found that I needed to open a browser a couple times for it to actually connect to the internet (which you need for the apt-get to work).
